## ARTICLE II: PURPOSE

### A. Business Purpose

This company shall be organized and shall conduct its business primarily for the mutual benefit of its members as patrons for the company. The earnings, savings, or benefits of the company shall be used for the general welfare of the members or shall be proportionately and equitably distributed to its members as patrons, based upon their patronage of the company.

The company is democratically controlled and is not organized to make a profit for itself, as such, but primarily for its members as patrons.

### B. Cooperative Purpose

To work cooperatively is to strike a balance between work that is profitable and enjoyable. The cooperative has achieved this balance when the business generates for its members real financial benefit and genuine gratification. The default mode of most businesses is to prioritize the collective financial profit of the company over the gratification of any individual worker. This worker cooperative reimagines the twin values of profit and gratification as neither mutually exclusive nor inherently hierarchical goals. Rather this worker cooperative will function as a dynamic business entity that can deftly navigate the turbulent events of changing market by balancing and incorporating worker gratification with the profit imperative. The cooperative must, therefore, champion its workers with as much vigor as it seeks to profit off their work and labor. When facing the unknowable challenges of the unwritten future, we recognize that twin goals of profit and joy can, should, and sometimes must fall out of balance for both to endure. These bylaws are written, therefore, to advance this company’s cooperative effort to balance when necessary and synthesize where possible these twin ambitions of profit and joy.
