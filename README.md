## unratified ByLaws

This is a **work in progress as of 1/24/2026**

*NOTE: any part of this document with "options" or empty checkboxes is to highlight what work remains.*

*The final draft cannot have options but must instead be clear and decisive with no room for misinterpretation.*

## Comments from 1/22/26 steering committee

1. We need to forground the decision making progress.

2. We need to ensure that the methods for changing the ByLaws are clear and legal and obvious.

3. Questions: how do we square the voting methods with quorum especially considering the small of the company now, e.g, if 4 members constitute a quorum with 6 members and a vote is taken, and the operating rules specify "unanimous-minus-one" and one member votes Nay and three members vote Yea, which satisfies the "unanimous-minus-one" rule, does that vote, which constitutes only 1/2 of the overall members, still count as a quorom?

Another way to ask this question is: how would a "unanimous-minus-one" method of voting affect how we define a quorom?

No yelling rule, a.k.a., cooldowns and the goal of resolving conflicts dispassionately.

## STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT

This README contains the rough outline of the structure. Only the text we have worked on is included in the README. The draft-bylaws contain a lot of boilerplate to remind our future selves about what else we might need to think about. Boilerplate and/or under-considered parts are *italicized*.

## NOTES ABOUT THE ICA MODEL BYLAWS

We intentionally sought reference outside of the ICA Model ByLaws because the ICA Model ByLaws are 20+ years old. Parts must surely be out of date and, even if it turns out they have stood the test of time, they are the official recommendation ... which means whatever we produce will eventually, inevitably bend toward them anyway.

None of this has been voted on internally. All of it is subject to edits, rewording, revisions, excisions, expansion, etc.

## ARTICLE I: ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

*The existing business is GREEN MOUNTAIN INSULATED GLASS INC.*

*The articles of incorporation are hereby made a part of these ByLaws. In case of any inconsistency between the articles of incorporation and these ByLaws, the provisions of the articles of incorporation are controlling.*

## ARTICLE II: PURPOSE

### A. Business Purpose

*This company shall be organized and shall conduct its business primarily for the mutual benefit of its members as patrons for the company. The earnings, savings, or benefits of the company shall be used for the general welfare of the members or shall be proportionately and equitably distributed to its members as patrons, based upon their patronage of the company.*

*The company is democratically controlled and is not organized to make a profit for itself, as such, but primarily for its members as patrons.*

### B. Cooperative Purpose

To work cooperatively is to strike a balance between work that is profitable and enjoyable. The cooperative has achieved this balance when the business generates for its members real financial benefit and genuine gratification. The default mode of most businesses is to prioritize the collective financial profit of the company over the gratification of any individual worker. This worker cooperative reimagines the twin values of profit and gratification as neither mutually exclusive nor inherently hierarchical goals. Rather this worker cooperative will function as a dynamic business entity that can deftly navigate the turbulent events of changing market by balancing and incorporating worker gratification with the profit imperative. The cooperative must, therefore, champion its workers with as much vigor as it seeks to profit off their work and labor. When facing the unknowable challenges of the unwritten future, we recognize that twin goals of profit and joy can, should, and sometimes must fall out of balance for both to endure. These ByLaws are written, therefore, to advance this company’s cooperative effort to balance when necessary and synthesize where possible these twin ambitions of profit and joy.

## ARTICLE III: DEFINITIONS

## ARTICLE IV: PROCESS OF DECISION MAKING

Matters will be discussed with the goal of seeking decision-making by consensus.

### Voting

The voting power of the members shall be equal.

There shall be no voting by proxy.

There shall be no cumulative voting.

If a decision cannot be made by consensus, the matter shall be worded as a motion and the members shall vote on the motion.

  1. The motion in question passes if it is approved by all votes.

  2. The motion in question passes if it is rejected by one or fewer (i.e., zero) votes.

  3. The motion in question fails it is rejected by more than one vote.

### Conflict of Interest Rule

Members are disqualified from voting on matters for which there is a conflict of interest.

Matters directly pertaining to a member’s spouse/partner or close relative are considered to be de facto conflicts of interest; no member may vote on matters concerning their spouse/partner or close relative.

Close relatives include:

- grandparents,
- parents,
- children,
- grandchildren,
- aunts,
- uncles,
- nieces,
- nephews,
- first cousins
- any legal and/or common-law “in-law” variants of the above

Whenever members are disqualified from voting on any matter, they shall not be counted for the determination of the quorum required to approve a motion.

### Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners

"The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" is as follows:
  
- If the company has 10 or fewer employee-owners, the motion to accept new employee-owners must receive unanimous approval from all members eligible to vote.

If the company has more than ten employee-owners, the worker-owners must, at the annual meeting, vote to to approve or reject "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners". This vote to approve or reject "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" requires a unanimous vote to pass.

If the motion to approve "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" passes AND the company has more than 10 employees at the next annual meeting, the motion to approve or reject "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" must recur.

If the motion to approve "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" fails, any member may make a motion to adopt a new rule regarding the voting process for accepting new employee-owners. If this motion is seconded, it must receive unanimous approval to pass.

If no motion to adopt a new rule regarding the voting process for accepting new employee-owners has been made or no motion passes, any member may move to adopt "The Backup Rule" which shall be: the vote to accept new employee-owners must receive 85% approval from all members eligible to vote.

- This default method requires a majority of votes to pass.
  
- Failure to pass the default motion establishes "The Default Rule" which shall be: the vote to accept new employee-owners must receive 75% approval from all members eligible to vote
  
- "The Default Rule" can be changed only by modifying the ByLaws.

## ARTICLE V: MEMBERSHIP

### A. Membership Defined

### B. Classification of members

*The company shall have one (1) class of members.*

### C. Membership Qualifications

### D. Acceptance of Members

**(*We haven't properly discussed this section*)**
The members shall decide by the modified consensus process described in **Article TBD** whether to accept an application for membership. If an application is not accepted, the applicant’s employment shall be immediately terminated, unless the members, by the modified consensus process, choose to specify a further Candidacy Period to be followed by a second decision by the members whether to accept the application. Upon acceptance of an application, the applicant shall immediately become a member.

In the case of an application by a former member, the company may waive the Candidacy Period and accept back the former member immediately by the affirmative vote of all the members.

### E. Membership Resignation

*A member shall have the right to resign as a member of the company by filing with the secretary of the company a written notice of resignation. The resignation shall become effective immediately without any action on the part of the company. An individual will not be allowed to work for the company for one month following voluntary termination of membership unless their membership is reinstated by the company. Resignation shall not relieve the resigning member from any obligation for charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees, and this section shall not diminish any right of the company to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages for its breach.*

### F. Process for the Removal of Members

**(*We discussed this briefly*)**

No member may be expelled or suspended, and no membership or memberships may be terminated or suspended, except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section.

A member may for any lawful reason be expelled from the company by a

~[ ] vote of seventy-five percent (75%) or greater of the members at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present.~

~[ ] vote of eighty-five percent (85%) or greater of the members at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present.~

**(*The feeling was this section needed to be done with great care and reflection. The general sense was that it shouldn't only come down to a vote but that maybe there should also be reference to policies or rules. Having said that, the vote should be difficult, i.e., unanimous or unanimou-minus-one.*)**

[ ] unanimous-minus-one or greater of the members at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present.

[ ] unanimous vote of the members at a duly called meeting at which a quorum is present.

*The member must be given 15 days’ prior notice of the expulsion, suspension, or termination and the reasons therefor and the member shall have an opportunity to be heard, orally or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the expulsion, suspension, or termination by a person or body authorized to decide that the proposed expulsion, termination, or suspension not take place.*

*Any notice required under this section may be given by any method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice. Any notice given by mail must be given by first-class or registered mail sent to the last address of the members shown on the company’s records.*

*A member who is expelled or suspended or whose membership is terminated shall be liable for any charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees incurred before expulsion, suspension, or termination or arising from contract or otherwise.*

*The company may direct a member whose expulsion is being considered to refrain from conducting business as a member until the expulsion decision is made, provided the company pays the member their average weekly wage – calculated based on the three months preceding the date of the notice given pursuant to this section – until the expulsion decision is made. The company may also direct a member whose expulsion is being considered to stay away from the company’s places of business except as necessary to exercise her or his rights under law.*

### G. Suspension or Expulsion of Worker-Owners

5. *Being declared incapacitated by final order of a court;*

6. Using the Cooperative for personal financial gain in a manner that, either intentionally or accidentally, limits, hinders, detracts, or otherwise diminishes the overall capacity of the Cooperative to benefit the other members;

**(*We added this*)**
Members are disqualified from voting on matters for which there is a conflict of interest.

**(*This is incomprehensible legal gibberish*)**
*In the event that elections are required due to any change in the provision that the directors shall be the members, board elections shall be held at the annual meeting; in the absence of such change, the members shall vote to set the number of directors as equal to the number of members and elect all of the members to the board at each annual meeting (unless there are fewer than three members in which case the members shall elect the number of non-member directors required to bring the number of directors to three). Any other proper business may be transacted at the meeting.*

### D. Special Meetings

**(*More gibberish*)**
*Special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by the board, the president, or by 5 percent or more of the members. The procedure for calling a special meeting shall be as follows: (1) when the board, the president, or 5 percent or more of the members decide to call a special meeting, he/she/they shall submit a request in writing to the company addressed to the attention of the president or secretary and (2) the officer that receives the request, within 20 days after receipt, shall cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time fixed by the board not less than 35 nor more than 90 days after the receipt of the request.*

### E. Participation by Electronic Communications

**(*Gibberish*)**
*If authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to the consent of any members so participating, members not physically present in person at a meeting of members may, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation or by electronic video screen communication, participate in a meeting, be deemed present in person, and vote at a meeting of members, provided that the corporation implements measures to provide members a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting concurrently with those proceedings, and a record of any vote or action of any members participating by electronic transmission is maintained by the corporation.*

*Any request by the company to a member for consent to conduct a meeting of members by electronic transmission by and to the corporation shall include a notice that absent consent of the member, the meeting shall be held at a physical location.*

### F. Notice

**(*Gibberish*)**
*Whenever the members are required to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote thereat; provided, however, that if notice is given by mail, and the notice is not mailed by first-class, registered, or certified mail, that notice shall be given not less than 20 days before the meeting.*

*The notice shall state the place, date, and time of the meeting, the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate in that meeting, and (1) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case of the regular meeting, those matters which the board, at the time the notice is given, intends to present for action by the members.

*If any notice or report addressed to the member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the member at such address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the member upon written demand of the member at the principal office of the corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other members.*

- *The inability to so deliver notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.*

### G. Waiver of Notice

**(*Even more gibberish*)**
*The transactions of any meeting of members however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person, provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.*

*Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting.*

*Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes thereof.*

### H. Adjourned Meetings

**(*Gibberish continued*)**
*When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member of record entitled to vote at the meeting.*

### I. Quorum

**(*Gibberish Lite*)**
*A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the members entitled to vote shall be the act of the members unless the vote of a greater number is required by the articles or operating agreement.*

*The members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum or, if required by the articles or the operating agreement, the vote of the greater number so required.*

*In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented in person, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in the preceding paragraph.*

### J. Record Date

**(*Gibberish*)**
*The board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to vote at a meeting of members. Such record date shall not be more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. Such record date shall also apply in the case of an adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting. If no record date is fixed, members on the day of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting of members or, in the case of an adjourned meeting, members on the day of the adjourned meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting of members.*

## Appendix 1: Glossary

1. [Capital Expenditure (CapEx)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp)refers to money spent to buy, upgrade, or maintain long-term assets. Examples of CapEx include the purchase or lease of property (e.g., land, buildings, warehouses), equipment (e.g., manufacturing machinery, vehicles, computers), technology (e.g., software, IT infrastructure), and intangibles (e.g., patents, licenses, trademarks). CapEx should achieve, or attempt to achieve, an increase in productivity or an increase in efficiency, and can include significant maintenance for the upkeep of existing infrastructure.

2. [Operating Expenses (OpEx)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-are-different-types-operating-expenses.asp) are the day-to-day costs the Cooperative incurs. OpEx includes rent, salaries, utilities, and marketing.

3. [Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/what-are-some-examples-industries-cannot-claim-cost-goods-sold-cogs.asp) are the costs directly tied to producing goods.

10. Profit Margin

11. Acid Test: The acid-test ratio, also called the quick ratio, is a metric that's used to determine whether a company is positioned to sell assets within 90 days to meet immediate expenses. Analysts generally believe that a business can pay its immediate expenses if the ratio is more than 1.0. It can't do so if it's less than 1.0.

## Appendix 2: Questions to Consider

1. Mission, purpose, and legal structure

    This section often includes the cooperative’s mission statement, vision statement, or stated purpose. This is also a good place to restate the information outlined in the Articles of Incorporation. The Bylaws should agree with the Articles, but you may wish to include this useful phrase:

    “The articles of incorporation are hereby made a part of these ByLaws. In case of any inconsistency between the articles of incorporation and these ByLaws, the provisions of the articles of incorporation are controlling.”

2. Membership

    This section should describe each membership class (if more than one). For each membership class, outline who is eligible for membership, the requirements for membership, voting rights. Specify rules for suspension or termination of membership, including guidelines for returning member investments. Note that membership shares are often non-transferrable.In worker cooperatives, this section or an alternative section may also outline guidelines relating to additional rights and responsibilities of workers. Such guidelines may address working conditions, the pay scale or pay differential, and more.

3. Membership Meetings

    This section should address the details of annual (or periodic) general membership meetings. Such details may include:

    - How often are regular membership meetings held?
    - How is the agenda compiled?
    - How is the time and location of the meeting announced?
    - How are special membership meetings called?
    - How are special meetings announced? 3. What decision-making process is used?
    - Consensus?
    - Modified consensus?
    - Majority vote?
    - What percentage of participants must vote in favor in order to approve a decision?
    - Do stand-asides affect the outcome?

    Possible “majority” thresholds include 50% plus 1, 66%, 75%, and occasionally greater percentages.

4. Quorum

    What number or percentage of members is needed for quorum?

5. Board of Directors

Note: in some smaller cooperatives (especially collectives), the entire membership constitutes the governing body, or the Board.[2]  If this is the case, members may still find it useful to distinguish governance-level decisions from operational decisions.

The “Board Directors” section should answer these questions:

    - What is the minimum or maximum number of Board Directors? It may be useful to specify a range in the Bylaws, so the Board can grow if needed. Cooperatives often try to have an odd number of directors. Do you want the Board to reflect certain constituents? Many consumer-owned cooperatives strive to fill a certain number of seats with staff members.
    
    - How are Board Directors elected? How long are Board terms? Many cooperatives try to stagger terms, so that only about half of the Board seats are up for re-election at a time. This helps to ensure organizational stability and preserve institutional memory.
    
    - How are vacancies filled? Some cooperatives allow the Board Directors to fill vacant seats, while others require a special vote of the membership. Others offer vacant seats to runners-up from recent elections. 
    
    - Under what circumstances can Directors be removed? What is the process for removing Directors? In cases of serious misconduct or negligence, suspension or removal may be automatic. In other cases, there may need to be a mechanism for empowering members to recall Directors or Board Decisions.
    
    - Will Directors be paid for serving on the Board? If so, how much? Different states have different statutes.
    
    - Do you wish to prohibit Board Directors from voting if they have a conflict of interest (such as compensation of officers)? Here is a useful phrase: “It shall be the duty of all board directors to make prompt and full disclosure to the board of any personal, professional, or financial conflict of interest in a matter under discussion. When a conflict of interest is disclosed, the board member must not participate in the discussion or vote on the relevant issue.”
    
    - How often are Board Meetings held? How will the time and location be communicated to members? Under what circumstances can emergency Board meetings be called, and how will they be announced?
    
    - What are the general duties of Board Directors? What is their relationship to the management, staff, and members? 
    
    - What is the role of the management? Typically (co-)managers oversee daily operations in compliance with general guidelines set by the Board, and report to the Board of Directors.
    
    - Will there be Board Committees? Should these be defined in the Bylaws? How are Board Committees formed? What are the limitations of Board Committees’ decision-making power?

6. Board Officers

    The Board may be required to designate a President / Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and / or alternatives. Check your state’s requirements, and outline the duties of each officer in subsections. Also specify how officers are designated (elected directly by the membership or chosen by Board Directors) and how long their terms last.

7. Finances

Be sure to cover the following (check your state’s statutes):

    - How are net proceeds (both margins and losses) apportioned?

    - How are proceeds distributed?

    - What are your policies for patronage refunds and reserves?

    - Check the IRS code for guidelines for equity records. Cover equity redemption for terminating members, deceased members, and unclaimed equity.

    - Consent to patronage distributions. Another useful phrase:“Consent to patronage distributions” means that all members will report their co-op patronage refunds and retained capital equity to the IRS as earnings. Each year members will receive a 1099 form itemizing their patronage refunds earned in that year.” It is helpful to state in the Bylaws and in your membership contract that individuals consent to comply with relevant tax laws upon becoming members.

8. Administration and Miscellaneous

    This section can include a variety of topics (organized into subsections). Topics may include when the fiscal year begins, what meeting process is used (Robert’s Rules of Order, Butler’s Formal Consensus, or another system detailed in a separate text that can be referenced by members), use of a corporate seal or logo, indemnification and insurance coverage for Directors, financial reviews, options for advisory councils and committees, and more. Separate sections can be created for these topics if desired.

9. Amendment to the Bylaws

    It is important to state the procedure for amending the Bylaws. How does a Board Director or member propose an amendment? How is an amendment approved? (This often requires a period or special general membership meeting and a vote of the membership. Some cooperatives require that members petition for a special meeting and / or Bylaws change in order to demonstrate that their proposal has some support.)

10. Dissolution

    What procedures should be followed if the cooperative goes out of business? If members or Board Directors are interested in dissolving the cooperative voluntarily? How will remaining assets be divided? This part should be consistent with your Articles of Incorporation.

    In the event of dissolution, cooperatives often choose to distribute remaining assets to shareholders. Some cooperatives may distribute remaining assets to allied organizations.
