# This is a **work in progress as of 1/24/2026**

*NOTE: any part of this document with "options" or empty checkboxes is to highlight what work remains.*

*The final draft cannot have options but must be clear and decisive with no room for misinterpretation.*

## Comments from 1/22/26 steering committee

1. We need to forground the decision making progress.

2. We need to ensure that the methods for changing the ByLaws are clear and legal.

3. Questions: how do we square the voting methods with quorum especially considering the small size of the company now, e.g,

    - if 4 members constitute a quorum with 6 members and a vote is taken, and the operating rules specify "unanimous-minus-one" and one member votes Nay and three members vote Yea, which satisfies the "unanimous-minus-one" rule, does that vote, which constitutes only 1/2 of the overall members, still count as a quorom?

    - Another way to ask this question is: how would a "unanimous-minus-one" method of voting affect how we define a quorom?

4. No yelling rule, a.k.a., cooldowns and the goal of resolving conflicts dispassionately.

## ARTICLE I: ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION

The existing business is GREEN MOUNTAIN INSULATED GLASS INC.

[...]

The articles of incorporation are hereby made a part of these ByLaws. In case of any inconsistency between the articles of incorporation and these ByLaws, the provisions of the articles of incorporation are controlling.

## ARTICLE II: PURPOSE

### A. Business Purpose

This company shall be organized and shall conduct its business primarily for the mutual benefit of its members as patrons for the company. The earnings, savings, or benefits of the company shall be used for the general welfare of the members or shall be proportionately and equitably distributed to its members as patrons, based upon their patronage of the company.

The company is democratically controlled and is not organized to make a profit for itself, as such, but primarily for its members as patrons.

### B. Cooperative Purpose

To work cooperatively is to strike a balance between work that is profitable and enjoyable. The cooperative has achieved this balance when the business generates for its members real financial benefit and genuine gratification. The default mode of most businesses is to prioritize the collective financial profit of the company over the gratification of any individual worker. This worker cooperative reimagines the twin values of profit and gratification as neither mutually exclusive nor inherently hierarchical goals. Rather this worker cooperative will function as a dynamic business entity that can deftly navigate the turbulent events of changing market by balancing and incorporating worker gratification with the profit imperative. The cooperative must, therefore, champion its workers with as much vigor as it seeks to profit off their work and labor. When facing the unknowable challenges of the unwritten future, we recognize that twin goals of profit and joy can, should, and sometimes must fall out of balance for both to endure. These ByLaws are written, therefore, to advance this company’s cooperative effort to balance when necessary and synthesize where possible these twin ambitions of profit and joy.

## ARTICLE III: DEFINITIONS

## ARTICLE IV: PROCESS OF DECISION MAKING

Matters will be discussed with the goal of seeking decision-making by consensus.

### Voting

The voting power of the members shall be equal.

There shall be no voting by proxy.

There shall be no cumulative voting.

If a decision cannot be made by consensus, the matter shall be worded as a motion and the members shall vote on the motion.

  1. The motion in question passes if it is approved by all votes.

  2. The motion in question passes if it is rejected by one or fewer (i.e., zero) votes.

  3. The motion in question fails it is rejected by more than one vote.

### Conflict of Interest Rule

Members are disqualified from voting on matters for which there is a conflict of interest.

Matters directly pertaining to a member’s spouse/partner or close relative are considered to be de facto conflicts of interest: no member may vote on matters concerning their spouse/partner or close relative.

Close relatives include:

- grandparents,

- parents,

- children,

- grandchildren,

- aunts,

- uncles,

- nieces,

- nephews,

- first cousins, and

- any legal and/or common-law “in-law” variants of the above

Whenever members are disqualified from voting on any matter, they shall not be counted for the determination of the quorum required to approve a motion.

### The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners

"The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" is as follows:

- If the company has 10 or fewer employee-owners, the motion to accept new employee-owners must receive unanimous approval from all members eligible to vote.

If the company has more than ten employee-owners, the worker-owners must, at the annual meeting, vote to to approve or reject "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners".

"The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" requires a unanimous vote to pass.

If the motion to approve "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" passes AND the company has more than 10 employees at the next annual meeting, the motion to approve or reject "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" must recur at that and every subsequent annual meeting that satisfies this description.

If the motion to approve "The Special Unanimous Approval Rule For Accepting New Employee-Owners" fails, any member may make a motion to adopt a new rule regarding the voting process for accepting new employee-owners.

If this motion to adopt a new rule is seconded, it must receive unanimous approval to pass.

### The Backup Rule for Accepting New Employee-Owners

If no motion to adopt a new rule regarding the voting process for accepting new employee-owners has been made or if a motion has been made but fails to receive unanimous approval, and if no other motions are made, any member may "call the question". Upon calling the question, that member moves to adopt "The Backup Rule for Accepting New Employee-Owners" which shall be:

- The vote to accept new employee-owners must receive 85% approval from all members eligible to vote.

"The Backup Rule for Accepting New Employee-Owners" requires a majority of votes to pass.

#### The Default Rule for Accepting New Employee-Owners
  
Failure to pass "The Backup Rule for Accepting New Employee-Owners" establishes "The Default Rule for Accepting New Employee-Owners" which shall be:

- The vote to accept new employee-owners must receive 75% approval from all members eligible to vote. This motion passes automatically unless and until the ByLaws have been modified to change this process.

In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented in person, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in the preceding paragraph.

## ARTICLE VII: DIRECTORS

### A. Directors and Board Composition

All members of the corporation shall serve on the board of directors and no person other than the members of the corporation shall serve on the board of directors (except as provided in the following paragraph).

The number of directors shall be not less than three or more than twelve with the exact number of directors to be fixed, within the limits specified, by a vote of the members. If there are fewer than three members, the member(s) shall elect the minimum required number of directors to bring the total number of directors to three.

Should the number of members ever exceed twelve, the members shall immediately meet to amend the operating agreement to require that the board be elected from among the members.

Meetings of the members in their capacity as the board of directors shall be governed by [...]. Meetings of the members in their capacity as members shall be governed by [...].

### B. Terms of Office

The term of office of the directors shall be one year.

Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until the expiration of the term for which elected and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a person whose membership is terminated shall immediately cease to be a director of the corporation.

### C. Voting

The vote of [...] / a [...] vote of the directors present at a duly called and noticed meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the board.

Regular meetings will be held the first Thursday of every month at 11:00 AM at the principal office of the corporation. If the day fixed for the regular meeting falls on a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next business day.

Special meetings of the board shall be held upon four days’ notice by first-class mail or 48 hours’ notice delivered personally, by telephone, including a voice messaging system, or by electronic transmission by the corporation. A notice, or waiver of notice, need not specify the purpose of any regular or special meeting of the board.

### E. Waiver of Notice

### F. Participation by Electronic Transmission

### G. Quorum

A majority of the number of directors then in office constitutes a quorum of the board for the transaction of business.

### H. Adjournment

A majority of the directors present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time and place. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24 hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior to the time of the adjourned meeting to the directors who were not present at the time of the adjournment.

### I. Action Without a Meeting

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the board shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action. Such written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.

The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the directors.

### J. Board Vacancies

Given that all members constitute the board, vacancies will not occur on the board. Therefore, this section applies only if the provision requiring that all members constitute the board is amended to provide for election of directors (or if there are fewer than three members).

“Vacancy” when used with respect to the board means any authorized position of director which is not then filled, whether the vacancy is caused by death, resignation, removal, change in the number of directors authorized in the articles or operating agreement, or otherwise.

The board may declare vacant the office of a director whose eligibility for election as a director has ceased, or who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony.

Except for a vacancy created by the removal of a director, vacancies on the board may be filled by approval of the board or, if the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, by (1) the unanimous written consent of the directors then in office, (2) the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office at a meeting held pursuant to notice or waivers of notice, or (3) a sole remaining director.

Vacancies occurring on the board by reason of the removal of directors may be filled only by the members.

The members may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the directors.

### K. Resignation

So long as all members constitute the board, the only way that a director may resign is by ceasing to be a member (or if there are fewer than three members). Should the provision by which all members constitute the board be amended, any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the president, the secretary, or the board of directors of the corporation, unless the notice specifies a later time for the effectiveness of such resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be elected to take office when the resignation becomes effective.

### L. Removal

So long as all members constitute the board, directors may not be removed except if they cease to be members. Should the provision by which all members constitute the board be amended, any or all directors may be removed without cause by the members.

Any reduction of the authorized number of directors does not remove any director prior to the expiration of the director’s term of office.

### I. Dissolution Distributions

Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of the assets of the corporation, any assets left after payment of all debts and Member Account balances shall be distributed to all persons who were members, or to their heirs, in proportion to such members’ relative paid labor with the corporation.

Said notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent by certified mail, at least 30 days before distribution of any residual assets, to the person’s last known business or residence address.

## ARTICLE VIII: COMMITTEES

The board may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the number of directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, create one or more committees, each consisting of two or more directors, to serve at the pleasure of the board. Appointments to such committees shall be by a majority vote of the directors then in office. The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board or in the operating agreement, shall have all the authority of the board, except with respect to:

The board of directors by resolution may authorize any officer, officers, agent, or agents to enter into any contract or to execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation. This authority may be general or it may be confined to one or more specific matters. No officer, agent, employee, or other person purporting to act on behalf of the corporation will have any power or authority to bind the corporation in any way, to pledge the corporation’s credit, or to render the corporation liable for any purpose or in any amount, unless that person was acting with authority granted by the board of directors as provided in these operating agreement, or unless an unauthorized act was later ratified by the corporation.

Examples of CapEx include the purchase or lease of property (e.g., land, buildings, warehouses), equipment (e.g., manufacturing machinery, vehicles, computers), technology (e.g., software, IT infrastructure), and intangibles (e.g., patents, licenses, trademarks). CapEx should achieve, or attempt to achieve, an increase in productivity or an increase in efficiency, and can include significant maintenance for the upkeep of existing infrastructure.

2. [Operating Expenses (OpEx)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-are-different-types-operating-expenses.asp) are the day-to-day costs the Cooperative incurs. OpEx includes rent, salaries, utilities, and marketing.

## Appendix 2: Questions to Consider

1. Mission, purpose, and legal structure

    This section often includes the cooperative’s mission statement, vision statement, or stated purpose. This is also a good place to restate the information outlined in the Articles of Incorporation. The Bylaws should agree with the Articles, but you may wish to include this useful phrase:

    “The articles of incorporation are hereby made a part of these ByLaws. In case of any inconsistency between the articles of incorporation and these ByLaws, the provisions of the articles of incorporation are controlling.”

2. Membership

    This section should describe each membership class (if more than one). For each membership class, outline who is eligible for membership, the requirements for membership, voting rights. Specify rules for suspension or termination of membership, including guidelines for returning member investments. Note that membership shares are often non-transferrable.In worker cooperatives, this section or an alternative section may also outline guidelines relating to additional rights and responsibilities of workers. Such guidelines may address working conditions, the pay scale or pay differential, and more.

3. Membership Meetings

    This section should address the details of annual (or periodic) general membership meetings. Such details may include:

    - How often are regular membership meetings held?

    - How is the agenda compiled?

    - How is the time and location of the meeting announced?

    - How are special membership meetings called?

    - How are special meetings announced?

    - What decision-making process is used?

    - Consensus?

    - Modified consensus?

    - Majority vote?

    - What percentage of participants must vote in favor in order to approve a decision?

    - Do stand-asides affect the outcome?

    Possible “majority” thresholds include 50% plus 1, 66%, 75%, and occasionally greater percentages.

4. Quorum

    What number or percentage of members is needed for quorum?

5. Board of Directors

    Note: in some smaller cooperatives (especially collectives), the entire membership constitutes the governing body, or the Board.[2]  If this is the case, members may still find it useful to distinguish governance-level decisions from operational decisions.

    The “Board Directors” section should answer these questions:

        - What is the minimum or maximum number of Board Directors? It may be useful to specify a range in the Bylaws, so the Board can grow if needed. Cooperatives often try to have an odd number of directors. Do you want the Board to reflect certain constituents? Many consumer-owned cooperatives strive to fill a certain number of seats with staff members.
        
        - How are Board Directors elected? How long are Board terms? Many cooperatives try to stagger terms, so that only about half of the Board seats are up for re-election at a time. This helps to ensure organizational stability and preserve institutional memory.
        
        - How are vacancies filled? Some cooperatives allow the Board Directors to fill vacant seats, while others require a special vote of the membership. Others offer vacant seats to runners-up from recent elections. 
        
        - Under what circumstances can Directors be removed? What is the process for removing Directors? In cases of serious misconduct or negligence, suspension or removal may be automatic. In other cases, there may need to be a mechanism for empowering members to recall Directors or Board Decisions.
        
        - Will Directors be paid for serving on the Board? If so, how much? Different states have different statutes.
        
        - Do you wish to prohibit Board Directors from voting if they have a conflict of interest (such as compensation of officers)? Here is a useful phrase: “It shall be the duty of all board directors to make prompt and full disclosure to the board of any personal, professional, or financial conflict of interest in a matter under discussion. When a conflict of interest is disclosed, the board member must not participate in the discussion or vote on the relevant issue.”
        
        - How often are Board Meetings held? How will the time and location be communicated to members? Under what circumstances can emergency Board meetings be called, and how will they be announced?
        
        - What are the general duties of Board Directors? What is their relationship to the management, staff, and members? 
        
        - What is the role of the management? Typically (co-)managers oversee daily operations in compliance with general guidelines set by the Board, and report to the Board of Directors.
        
        - Will there be Board Committees? Should these be defined in the Bylaws? How are Board Committees formed? What are the limitations of Board Committees’ decision-making power?

6. Board Officers

    The Board may be required to designate a President / Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, and / or alternatives. Check your state’s requirements, and outline the duties of each officer in subsections. Also specify how officers are designated (elected directly by the membership or chosen by Board Directors) and how long their terms last.

7. Finances

    Be sure to cover the following (check your state’s statutes):

    - How are net proceeds (both margins and losses) apportioned?

    - How are proceeds distributed?

    - What are your policies for patronage refunds and reserves?

    - Check the IRS code for guidelines for equity records. Cover equity redemption for terminating members, deceased members, and unclaimed equity.

    - Consent to patronage distributions. Another useful phrase:“Consent to patronage distributions” means that all members will report their co-op patronage refunds and retained capital equity to the IRS as earnings. Each year members will receive a 1099 form itemizing their patronage refunds earned in that year.” It is helpful to state in the Bylaws and in your membership contract that individuals consent to comply with relevant tax laws upon becoming members.

8. Administration and Miscellaneous

    This section can include a variety of topics (organized into subsections). Topics may include when the fiscal year begins, what meeting process is used (Robert’s Rules of Order, Butler’s Formal Consensus, or another system detailed in a separate text that can be referenced by members), use of a corporate seal or logo, indemnification and insurance coverage for Directors, financial reviews, options for advisory councils and committees, and more. Separate sections can be created for these topics if desired.

9. Amendment to the Bylaws

    It is important to state the procedure for amending the Bylaws. How does a Board Director or member propose an amendment? How is an amendment approved? (This often requires a period or special general membership meeting and a vote of the membership. Some cooperatives require that members petition for a special meeting and / or Bylaws change in order to demonstrate that their proposal has some support.)

10. Dissolution

    What procedures should be followed if the cooperative goes out of business? If members or Board Directors are interested in dissolving the cooperative voluntarily? How will remaining assets be divided? This part should be consistent with your Articles of Incorporation.

    In the event of dissolution, cooperatives often choose to distribute remaining assets to shareholders. Some cooperatives may distribute remaining assets to allied organizations.
