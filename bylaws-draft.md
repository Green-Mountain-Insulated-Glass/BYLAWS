## ARTICLE VIII: ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

### A. Fiscal Year

The fiscal year of the corporation shall end on the last day of December of each year.

### C. Allocations

Any Profit shall be credited to the Collective Account.

Any Surplus shall be credited to the Collective Account as necessary to bring the year’s contribution to the Collective Account up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the year’s combined Profit/Surplus. All other Surplus shall be paid as Patronage Dividends in direct proportion to Patronage during the fiscal year.

Any Loss shall be allocated seventy-five percent (75%) to Member Accounts in direct proportion to Patronage during the fiscal year and twenty-five (25%) to the Collective Account, with the exception of Losses occurring and/or carried over from the corporation’s first two fiscal years which shall be allocated 100% to the Collective Account.

The percentages referred to in this section can be changed for a coming fiscal year by the board.

### D. Patronage Dividends

Patronage Dividends shall be made fifty percent (50%) in cash and fifty percent (50%) to each individual Member Account as a written notice of allocation, unless different proportions are approved by the board within eight-and-a-half months of the fiscal year’s close – however, at least twenty percent (20%) must be distributed in cash.

Patronage Dividends may be by qualified or non-qualified written notices of allocation or a combination of the two.

### E. Member’s Covenant to Declare Income for Tax Purposes

Each member shall take into account on his or her income tax return the amount of any Patronage Dividends which are made in qualified written notices of allocation (as defined in [26 U.S.C. Section 1388)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1388) at their stated dollar amounts in the manner provided in [26 U.S.C. Section 1385(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1385) in the taxable year in which such written notices of allocation are received by the member.

### F. Payment Rights Regarding Member Accounts

When a member’s membership in the corporation is terminated for any reason, the amount in her or his Member Account will automatically be redeemed in exchange for debt. The corporation shall repay the debt within five years of the membership termination, with interest accruing at the discount rate – as set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York – plus two percent (2%), on the amount outstanding at the end of each fiscal year.

The corporation, in settling a Member Account, shall have the right to set off any and all indebtedness of the former member to the corporation.

### G. Periodic Redemption of Member Accounts

The corporation shall aim to pay out in cash to the members all funds credited to their Member Accounts within three (3) years of the date they were first credited. As a general rule, written notices of allocation credited to Member Accounts (including notices now converted to debt) will be paid out in the order in which they are credited, with the oldest paid out first; however, the board can decide to accelerate the repayment of debt owed to former members on a case by case basis. If the corporation does not have sufficient funds to pay out all funds credited to Member Accounts for a given fiscal year, then funds will be paid out in proportion to the balance in the Member Accounts.

### H. Unclaimed Equity Interests

Any proprietary interest in the corporation held by a member that would otherwise escheat to the State of Vermont as unclaimed personal property shall instead become the property of the corporation if the corporation gives at least 60 days prior notice of the proposed transfer to the affected member by (1) first-class or second-class mail to the last address of the member shown on the corporation’s records, and (2) by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the corporation has its principal office. No property or funds shall become the property of the corporation under this section if written notice objecting to the transfer is received by the corporation from the affected member prior to the date of the proposed transfer.

### I. Dissolution Distributions

Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of the assets of the corporation, any assets left after payment of all debts and Member Account balances shall be distributed to all persons who were members, or to their heirs, in proportion to such members’ relative paid labor with the corporation. No distribution need be made to any person who fails to acknowledge the receipt of notice of liquidation in a timely manner. Said notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent by certified mail, at least 30 days before distribution of any residual assets, to the person’s last known business or residence address.
