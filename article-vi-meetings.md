### A. Distinction between Membership and Board Meetings


**Meetings of the members in their capacity as members shall be governed by this Article III.**

**Meetings of the members in their capacity as the board of directors shall be governed by Article IV.**

### B. Member Voting

The voting power of the members shall be equal.

Members are disqualified from voting on matters for which there is a conflict of interest. Matters directly pertaining to a member’s spouse/partner or close relative are considered to be de facto conflicts of interest; no member may vote on matters concerning their spouse/partner or close relative. Close relatives include: grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and first cousins, as well as any legal and/or common-law “in-law” variants of the above.

Whenever members are disqualified from voting on any matter, they shall not be counted for the determination of a quorum or the required vote to approve an action.

There shall be no voting by proxy.

There shall be no cumulative voting.

Unless otherwise specified, all votes shall be conducted using the procedures in Article VII.

### C. Annual Meeting

An annual meeting of members shall be held on the first Thursday in November at 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time over video call. If the day fixed for the annual meeting falls on a legal holiday, the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the following business day. 

In the event that elections are required due to any change in the provision that the directors shall be the members, board elections shall be held at the annual meeting; in the absence of such change, the members shall vote to set the number of directors as equal to the number of members and elect all of the members to the board at each annual meeting (unless there are fewer than three members in which case the members shall elect the number of non-member directors required to bring the number of directors to three). Any other proper business may be transacted at the meeting.

### D. Special Meetings

Special meetings of members for any lawful purpose may be called by the board, the president, or by 5 percent or more of the members. The procedure for calling a special meeting shall be as follows: (1) when the board, the president, or 5 percent or more of the members decide to call a special meeting, he/she/they shall submit a request in writing to the company addressed to the attention of the president or secretary and (2) the officer that receives the request, within 20 days after receipt, shall cause notice to be given to the members entitled to vote that a meeting will be held at a time fixed by the board not less than 35 nor more than 90 days after the receipt of the request. 

### E. Participation by Electronic Communications

If authorized by the board of directors in its sole discretion, and subject to the consent of any members so participating, members not physically present in person at a meeting of members may, by electronic transmission by and to the corporation or by electronic video screen communication, participate in a meeting, be deemed present in person, and vote at a meeting of members, provided that the corporation implements measures to provide members a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the members, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting concurrently with those proceedings, and a record of any vote or action of any members participating by electronic transmission is maintained by the corporation. 

Any request by the company to a member for consent to conduct a meeting of members by electronic transmission by and to the corporation shall include a notice that absent consent of the member, the meeting shall be held at a physical location.

### F. Notice

Whenever the members are required to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote thereat; provided, however, that if notice is given by mail, and the notice is not mailed by first-class, registered, or certified mail, that notice shall be given not less than 20 days before the meeting.

The notice shall state the place, date, and time of the meeting, the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate in that meeting, and (1) in the case of a special meeting, the general nature of the business to be transacted, and no other business may be transacted, or (2) in the case of the regular meeting, those matters which the board, at the time the notice is given, intends to present for action by the members. The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the names of all those who are nominees at the time the notice is given to members.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any of the following decisions, other than by unanimous approval by those entitled to vote, shall be valid only if the general nature of the proposal was stated in the notice of meeting or in any written waiver of notice:

- Removal of directors;
- Election of a director to fill a vacancy;
- Approval of a contract or other transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors, or between a corporation and any corporation, firm, or association in which one or more of its directors has a material financial interest or is a director;
- Amendment of the articles of incorporation; and
- Approval of a plan of distribution upon winding up of the corporation.

Notice of a members’ meeting or any report shall be given personally, by electronic transmission by the corporation, or by mail or other means of written communication, addressed to a member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the member to the corporation for purpose of notice; or if no such address appears or is given, at the place where the principal office of the corporation is located or by publication at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office is located. 

If any notice or report addressed to the member at the address of such member appearing on the books of the corporation is returned to the corporation by the United States Postal Service marked to indicate the United States Postal Service is unable to deliver the notice or report to the member at such address, all future notices or reports shall be deemed to have been duly given without further mailing if the same shall be available for the member upon written demand of the member at the principal office of the corporation for a period of one year from the date of the giving of the notice or report to all other members.

Notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation under this section after either of the following:

- The corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by that means
- The inability to so deliver notices to the member becomes known to the secretary, any assistant secretary, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.

### G. Waiver of Notice

The transactions of any meeting of members however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is present, and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person, provides a waiver of notice or consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof in writing. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. 

Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at such meeting, except when the person objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and except that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice but not so included, if such objection is expressly made at the meeting. 

Neither the business to be transacted at nor the purpose of any regular or special meeting of members need be specified in any written waiver of notice, consent to the holding of the meeting, or approval of the minutes thereof.

### H. Adjourned Meetings

When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

### I. Quorum

A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the members entitled to vote shall be the act of the members unless the vote of a greater number is required by the articles or operating agreement.

The members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough members to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum or, if required by the articles or the operating agreement, the vote of the greater number so required.

In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of members may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the votes represented in person, but no other business may be transacted, except as provided in the preceding paragraph.

### J. Record Date

The board may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the members entitled to vote at a meeting of members. Such record date shall not be more than 60 days before the date of the meeting. Such record date shall also apply in the case of an adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting. If no record date is fixed, members on the day of the meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the meeting of members or, in the case of an adjourned meeting, members on the day of the adjourned meeting who are otherwise eligible to vote are entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting of members.
